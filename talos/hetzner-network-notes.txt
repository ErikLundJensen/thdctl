Configuration of vswitch, LB and dedicated Server

  In order to use the cloud network from your dedicated server you need to configure it to:

  Create a private network interface with correct vlan id and set mtu to 1,400 bytes

  Use a unique IP address from the vSwitch subnet 10.250.250.16/28

  Add a route for the whole cloud network 10.250.250.0/24 pointing to gateway 10.250.250.17
  For example, if the private IP address of your dedicated server is 10.250.250.18, its network interface is called enp0s31f6, and the VLAN ID of the linked vSwitch is 4000, then a temporary configuration on your dedicated server would be:

  Create Interface
  ip link add link enp0s31f6 name enp0s31f6.4000 type vlan id 4000
  ip link set enp0s31f6.4000 mtu 1400
  ip link set dev enp0s31f6.4000 up
  Set IP address and route
  ip addr add 10.250.250.18/28 dev enp0s31f6.4000
  ip route add 10.250.250.0/24 via 10.250.250.17

  Please note that this configuration will not persist across reboots. For more information visit our Docs.

Inbound traffic:
  vSwitch + Load Balanccer + Privat network (costs and limits and complexity, )
  DNS load balancing (TTL must be short, requires management of DNS entries, failover takes TTL sec)

Switch comments:
	higher price for IPv4 addresses
	"For this vSwitch, traffic usage of 1 TB/month (outgoing) is free. Additional outgoing traffic will be charged at € 1.25 (incl. 25 % VAT) per additional TB."
	Load Balancer: 20TB per month (note, image downloads also counts in that traffic)
	Alterative is DNS load balancing if we can control the domains.

  Consider using a vSwitch for inter-node communication. That would require two IP addresses - one for the intenal and one for external
    An extra IP cost €2.13 pr month.
  Consider using IPv6 for inter-node communication.

Enable encryption in Cilium with wireguard
  https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/network/encryption-wireguard/
  Multi-cluster, remember to open UDP port 51871

The configuration must contain list of all IP addresses

Using Private network (for vSwitch):
This will tell the machine that 10.0.0.1 is behind that eth0 link:
machine:
  network:
    interfaces:
      - interface: eth0
        dhcp: true
        mtu: 8765
        routes:
          - network: 0.0.0.0/0
            gateway: 10.0.0.1
         - network: 10.0.0.1/32


Network conclusion of 27/1
* vSwitch with private network could be tested, however, no one has proven that it works.
* Hubble-peer can't connect to cilium-agent at port 4245. Firewall has been disabled, maybe disable-sip-validation would work around.
  Have not found the reason why it can't connect.
  Try to deploy more workload to the cluster to see if there is some generic network problem.

TODO:
* enable encryption
* Does Cilium support host network policies? Is unencrypted traffic allowed?


IPv6:
* Single IPv6 stack is not really production ready.
